// Loops => there many kinds of loops in js.

// for-of loop

// this loop used the display elements of an array.

let stuff = [45, 78, 0.7, 53];

for (let key of stuff) console.log(key);

// In for-of loop, the key is generated after each iteration returns the value of the element instead of propertie/metadata.

// For-of loops are only used for arrays and use of for-in loop is not recommended for arrays.
