// Bitwise Operators => these are used to do operations between binary values.

// 1 = 00000001
// 2 = 00000010

// Bitwise OR ( | )
console.log(2 | 1);
// here it will compare both the binary values bitwise at each index and return the true value for that index in output if atleast one of the value is true.

// Bitwise AND ( & )
console.log(1 & 2);
// here it will compare both the binary values at each bit by index and return true only when both the values at the same index are also true.
